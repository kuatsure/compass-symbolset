# Compass Plugin for Symboset

*Keep in mind you'll need to buy the font libraries from Symbolset for this plugin to be of any use to you and your project*

## Install
```
sudo gem install compass-symbolset-plugin
```

## Usage
Add the following to your `config.rb` in your compass project
```rb
require 'compass-symbolset'
```

Import it in your `.scss` file.
```scss
@import 'compass-symbolset'
```

Copy the font libraries to your `font_dir`.

Enjoy!

Currently only supports the Standard & Social libraries.
